        - Hello, friends.
        0:01
        I'm leaving now to go deep into the Amazon jungle
        0:03
        with my friend, the incredible Paul Rosolie,
        0:07
        deep to parts of the rainforest
        0:09
        that very few humans have ever seen.
        0:12
        I will try my best not to get eaten by anything.
        0:17
        The purpose of this trip is to celebrate nature
        0:19
        at its purest and most intense,
        0:22
        and to celebrate the work of people like Paul,
        0:24
        who have dedicated their life to protecting the jungle,
        0:27
        and the endless diversity of life that call it home.
        0:31
        If you want to support Paul in his work,
        0:33
        please donate or reach out to Jungle Keepers.
        0:36
        See the link in the description.
        0:39
        I hope to get back in one piece
        0:42
        and have some stories to tell,
        0:43
        and I will also try to record a podcast with Paul
        0:46
        when we're deep in the jungle.
        0:48
        I'll be offline until I emerge out.
        0:51
        Meanwhile, no internet, no phone,
        0:54
        no connection to the outside world,
        0:57
        just the raw, beautiful immensity of nature.
        1:02
        I am truly grateful to be alive, to have gotten the chance
        1:07
        to live on this beautiful planet of ours
        1:09
        with all of you, my fellow humans.
